Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is an important physiological indicator of cardiac autonomic regulation, which is important in the risk and prediction of cardiac diseases. 
In this thesis, the algorithmic practice for the classification and risk prediction of cardiac diseases is realized based on HRV features. 
Firstly, the ECG data in the public data-set are preprocessed by signal processing techniques to extract the HRV values and calculate the feature matrix. 
Secondly, the extracted HRV features are classified and predicted using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and deep learning models respectively. 
Finally, the effectiveness and accuracy of the two types of algorithms are verified through experiments and performance comparisons are realized. 
The experimental results show that the algorithms for classification and risk prediction of cardiac diseases based on HRV features have high accuracy and reliability, 
and the machine learning algorithm achieves an accuracy of 86.87% for the classification of congestive heart failure CHF diseases, 
and the deep learning algorithm achieves an accuracy of 99.85% for the classification of cardiac arrhythmia diseases, which can provide an important reference for clinical diagnosis and treatment. 
In addition, a real-time human ECG signal acquisition and analysis system is also constructed in this thesis using wearable electronics and microprocessors.
